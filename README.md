# IoT-based-flood-avoidance-system
This project is based on Arduino IDE. In this project Ultrasonic sensor is used for Water level monitoring from Dam. 
If water level is above given condition in code, Buzzer will give alert. 

We can see this data on thingSpeak cloud as a graph.

##### Open this code in Arduino IDE. #####

Use Ultrasonic sensor to calculate water level.

Connections for Ultrasonic sensor is given in code.
